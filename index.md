I’m Izalul, 23yr old Cloud Native Technology Enthusiast & Security Enthusiast. I love to build & break things and I open-source almost everything I can, mostly for security and bug bounty stuff that to pwn & automate all the things.

I have degree bachelor Computer Engineering especially Cyber Security, so keep in mind that if you want to ![hire me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/izalul/), I’m working as IT Infrastructure Engineer at [Mitra Informatika](https://mit.id/)currently learning how to code.
